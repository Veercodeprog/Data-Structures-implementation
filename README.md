## Guidelines

Please keep the following guidelines in mind when contributing:

- Only coding problems that are qualified to be asked in good interviews will be added. We aim to select problems that demonstrate important concepts and techniques in DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms).
- Problems based on repetitive or trivial ideas may not be added to keep the list concise and focused on important topics.
- Our goal is to create a small yet comprehensive collection of problems that can help you qualify for coding exams and improve your competitive programming skills.
- If there is an existing pseudocode file for an algorithm, consider improving or optimizing it instead of creating a new one.

# Daily Coding Problems

Welcome to Daily Coding Problems, a repository dedicated to challenging coding problems and fostering discussions on various approaches and solutions. Join us on this coding adventure where we strive to enhance our problem-solving skills and share knowledge with fellow programmers.

## Contribution

To contribute and become a collaborator, follow these steps:

1. **Add Your Name**: Join the [Contribute Discussion](https://github.com/Veercodeprog/Data-Structures-implementation/discussions/categories/contribute) and add your name to the list of contributors. We value your participation!

2. **Fork, Modify, and Open Pull Requests**: Fork this repository, make changes in your forked repository, and open pull requests to propose your modifications.

   - Step 1: Create a new branch named "Add-problem" and add your files directly by clicking the edit button or fork the repository and make changes in your forked repository.
   - Step 2: In the "Add-problem" branch, create a file with a descriptive problem statement as comments at the top and provide your solution in your preferred programming language. Place the file in the relevant topic folder (e.g., "linked-list" for linked list problems).
   - Step 3: Create a pull request and wait for it to be reviewed and merged.

## Coding Discussions

Engage in lively discussions on coding problems in the [Coding Discussion](https://github.com/Veercodeprog/Data-Structures-implementation/discussions/categories/coding-discussion-share-your-solution-with-best-time-complexity-approach) section. Participate in ongoing discussions, share your solutions, and explore efficient time complexities. A daily problem will be posted, and the solution with the best time complexity submitted first will be selected as the accepted solution.

## Best Repositories
