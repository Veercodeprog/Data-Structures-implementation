Welcome to Daily Brain Boosters, where we believe in firing up those brain cylinders and challenging ourselves with coding problems that make us go "Whoa!" If you've got an idea for a mind-bending problem or a brilliant solution, we'd love to have your contribution!

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository:** Start by forking this repository to your own GitHub account. This will create a copy of the repository under your account.

2. **Choose a Topic:** Browse through the existing folders and find the appropriate topic or create a new folder if needed. We want to keep things organized, so let's place array problems in the array folder, string problems in the string folder, and so on.
